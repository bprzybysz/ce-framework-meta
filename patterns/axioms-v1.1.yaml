core_axioms:
  identity:
    - axiom: "UNIQUE_IDENTITY"
      description: "Every pattern must have a globally unique identifier (UUID or namespaced string)"
      rationale: "Enables unambiguous pattern references across distributed systems and versions"
      
    - axiom: "SEMANTIC_NAMING"
      description: "Pattern names must be human-readable, semantically meaningful, and follow kebab-case convention"
      rationale: "Improves discoverability and understanding in catalog browsing"
      
    - axiom: "SELF_DESCRIBING"
      description: "Every pattern includes a description field with purpose, use cases, and constraints"
      rationale: "Enables autonomous pattern discovery and selection by AI agents"

  serialization:
    - axiom: "SCHEMA_COMPLIANCE"
      description: "All patterns serialize to JSON/YAML conforming to versioned schemas in /schemas/"
      rationale: "Ensures interoperability and validation across tools and implementations"
      
    - axiom: "BIDIRECTIONAL_MAPPING"
      description: "Patterns support lossless serialization and deserialization (graph ↔ file)"
      rationale: "Enables version control, review, and programmatic manipulation"
      
    - axiom: "METADATA_PRESERVATION"
      description: "Serialization preserves all metadata: authorship, timestamps, versioning, lineage"
      rationale: "Supports audit trails, governance, and pattern evolution tracking"

  relationships:
    - axiom: "EXPLICIT_DEPENDENCIES"
      description: "Patterns declare all dependencies using typed edges: DEPENDS_ON, COMPOSES, EXTENDS, VALIDATES, CONFLICTS_WITH"
      rationale: "Enables dependency resolution, conflict detection, and composition validation"
      
    - axiom: "ACYCLIC_DEPENDENCIES"
      description: "DEPENDS_ON relationships must form a directed acyclic graph (DAG)"
      rationale: "Prevents circular dependencies and enables topological ordering for application"
      
    - axiom: "TRANSITIVE_CLOSURE"
      description: "Dependency resolution includes transitive dependencies (if A→B, B→C, then A→→C)"
      rationale: "Ensures complete dependency sets for pattern instantiation"
      
    - axiom: "CONFLICT_EXPLICIT"
      description: "Mutually exclusive patterns must declare CONFLICTS_WITH edges"
      rationale: "Prevents invalid pattern combinations at validation time"

  versioning:
    - axiom: "SEMANTIC_VERSIONING"
      description: "Patterns use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for evolution tracking"
      rationale: "Communicates compatibility and enables automated migration strategies"
      
    - axiom: "IMMUTABLE_VERSIONS"
      description: "Published pattern versions are immutable; changes require new version"
      rationale: "Ensures reproducibility and prevents breaking changes to existing references"
      
    - axiom: "MIGRATION_PATHS"
      description: "Breaking version changes (MAJOR) must include migration instructions or automated transforms"
      rationale: "Enables consumers to upgrade without manual intervention"

  validation:
    - axiom: "VALIDATION_RULES"
      description: "All patterns have associated validation rules (structural, semantic, quality)"
      rationale: "Ensures pattern correctness before application and during evolution"
      
    - axiom: "COMPOSITIONAL_VALIDATION"
      description: "Pattern compositions validate as a whole, not just individual patterns"
      rationale: "Catches integration issues and emergent conflicts"
      
    - axiom: "FAIL_FAST"
      description: "Validation failures prevent pattern application and provide actionable feedback"
      rationale: "Reduces debugging time and prevents corrupt states"

  governance:
    - axiom: "LIFECYCLE_STATES"
      description: "Patterns progress through states: DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → DEPRECATED"
      rationale: "Enforces quality gates and controlled evolution"
      
    - axiom: "OWNERSHIP_TRACKING"
      description: "Every pattern has designated owners/maintainers for governance"
      rationale: "Enables accountability and contact for questions/issues"
      
    - axiom: "META_SEPARATION"
      description: "Pattern definitions (meta) are separated from implementations (concrete)"
      rationale: "Allows multiple implementations and independent evolution of specification"

  composability:
    - axiom: "COMPOSABLE_UNITS"
      description: "Patterns are designed as composable units that can be combined via COMPOSES edges"
      rationale: "Enables building complex patterns from simpler, reusable components"
      
    - axiom: "EXTENSION_POINTS"
      description: "Patterns can define extension points for customization via EXTENDS edges"
      rationale: "Supports framework extension without forking"

derived_principles:
  - "Patterns form a knowledge graph navigable by relationship type"
  - "Graph topology enables algorithmic pattern discovery and recommendation"
  - "Validation ensures graph integrity at all times"
  - "Versioning enables temporal queries (pattern state at time T)"
  - "Separation of meta and implementation enables polyglot implementations"
