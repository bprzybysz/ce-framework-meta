# CE Framework Meta Repository

This repo contains meta-level artifacts for the context engineering framework, focused on graph of patterns, axioms, governance, schema, and migration documentation.

## Purpose
- Define pattern axioms for new representation
- Maintain schemas and ontologies
- Separate meta-development from implementation
- Support multi-stage migration

## Structure
- `/schemas` - JSON/YAML schemas for pattern graph
- `/patterns` - Axioms and pattern definitions
- `/ontology` - Relationship & validation ontology
- `/migrations` - Documentation and tracking for migration cycles
- `/governance` - Approval workflow, lifecycle/deprecation policy
- `/docs` - Catalog, migration guide, API reference

## Initial Cycle Plan
See `migrations/stage-1-instructions.md` for initial refinement instructions.
