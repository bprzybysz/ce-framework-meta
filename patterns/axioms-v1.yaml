# Pattern Axioms v1
# Use these axioms to guide construction and serialization of patterns in the new graph-based framework.

axioms:
  - Every pattern must have a unique ID, name, description.
  - Patterns are serializable as nodes with axiom and constraint metadata.
  - Patterns explicitly define relationships: DEPENDS_ON, COMPOSES, EXTENDS, VALIDATES, CONFLICTS_WITH.
  - Patterns can be versioned and reflexively migrated.
  - Relationships and constraints are validated on each refinement cycle.
  - Validation rules for patterns must be documented and versioned.
  - Meta information (not implementation) must be isolated in this repo.
  - Serialization of patterns follows schemas in /schemas/.
